Unfortunately, I've lost my phone or someone may have stolen it. I'm not sure at the moment, but I need to report it to Contoso Inc. I'm very sorry to hear that, Louis. Let's get started on reporting your lost or stolen phone so we can protect. Your account and personal information. Can you provide me? With the last four digits of your phone number, please. Sure, it's 5432. Thank you. Louis. I've located your account. For security purposes. Can you also? Provide the last four digits of your Social. Security number. Yes, it's 6789. Thank you for verifying your identity. Louis. I have successfully located your account to help with identifying the phone. Can you recall your phone's IMEI number? I do have it written down somewhere. Let me check. OK, I've got it. It's 359-876-321-098. Thank you. For providing. The IMEI number. Louis. I've now successfully marked your phone as lost or stolen on our network. That means the phone won't be able to use any Contoso Incorporated services, which helps protect your account from unauthorized use. That's great to hear. Now, what should I do to get a new phone? If you have insurance with us, we can help you get a replacement phone at no extra cost, and your phone plan will transfer over to your new device. Unfortunately, Contoso Incorporated cannot provide a replacement device with a stolen phone that doesn't involve a physical theft or a police report. In that case, I'll visit the police station and file a report. But it's good to know that Contoso Incorporated is going to help me protect my account. Definitely, Louis. I'm glad I could help. Remember, if you're able to locate your phone or decide to give it a chance to be returned, don't hesitate to let us know by calling 1-800-123-4567 with the IMEI number. OK, will do. Thank you for your help, Janny. You're welcome, Louis. Is there anything? Else I can. Assist you with today. No, that's all I needed. Thanks again. My pleasure, Louis.
